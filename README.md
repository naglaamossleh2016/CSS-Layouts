## CSS Layout: Float, Grid, and Flexbox
CSS layout is the foundation of web design, determining how elements are positioned and interact on a webpage. 
This README introduces three widely used CSS layout techniques: Float, Grid, and Flexbox.
Each method has its strengths and use cases, catering to different layout requirements.
## Float
CSS Floats were traditionally used for layout design, allowing elements to be positioned to the left or right of their containing elements.
While floats are still relevant, newer layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid offer more powerful and flexible options.
## Grid
CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that enables precise control over both rows and columns. 
It is ideal for creating complex, grid-based designs and simplifies the development of responsive layouts.
## Flexbox
Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system that simplifies the design of flexible and responsive layouts.
It is particularly well-suited for arranging items in a single row or column, making it an excellent choice for simpler layouts.
